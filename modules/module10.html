			<h2>Separation of Content from Presentation</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
		My portfolio still needs a lot of work. I have most of my markup made, but I am still working on styling it with CSS.
		To separate the two, I am editing the stylesheet so that there is sufficient space between all the elements. I float certain
		elements and add padding where needed to make sure my text and images aren't running into each other. I am also using a similar
		CSS file for each page so that all pages will have the same layout with the same navigation and buttons, while still being able
		to have different content in the text, images, and links. So far, I think the biggest challenge I am facing is knowing how much
		space to put in between elements. It has taken a great deal of trial and error and I am not fully satisfied with it yet. There
		has also been difficulty designing navigation links as I have made some mistakes while turning div tags into functioning buttons.
		After some feedback from my SCRUM team, I will change some of the fonts and colors of the navigation links so that they appear
		separate from the content. As it is now, they look too much like markup text sitting inside colored div blocks. Once I have these
		elements working, I believe it will be easy to keep presentational information out of the markup.
