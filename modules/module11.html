	<p>When meeting with my scrum team, I mostly asked questions about my choices of design and structure for my website.
	I received some helpful advice regarding the layout of the pages. My group pointed out that certain fonts--the font used
	in my navigational links, for example--were inconsistent with the style of the rest of the page. My groups also suggested
	changing the look of my vertical nav bar if only for aesthetic purposes. This is where I got the idea to turn the links in
	the nav bar into separate buttons stacked on top of each other. However, the other members of my group could not provide
	much help with the actual coding of the site, as both of them were struggling with the same issues I was. I can say, though,
	that the meetings helped me deicide on an overall design for my website.</p>
	<p>I will admit that I got much more done outside of class than I did in it. During workshops, I spent most of my time resolving
	various issues I was having with my page. I had to go back through the lectures and Codecademy lessons to figure out how to make
	clickable buttons without putting them in block display so that I could keep my content next to them. I also required assistance
	repairing the links I put in my GitHub repository after they broke. Each time I resolved one of these issues, it allowed me to
	continue the process of programming and styling my page, which I did at home.</p>
	<p>I received a great deal of help from the instructor and from previous assignments and lectures in class. These answered most
	of the questions I still had while working on my site. I also occasionally used tutorial websites like www.w3schools.com to find more
	instructions for certain tags I had forgotten.</p>
