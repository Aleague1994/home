<p class="content">I am currently a professional writing student at Michigan State University with a specialty in digital and technical writing. Even in the digital age, writing remains a crucial part of business and the media. It is important for people to comprehend and be able to use new forms of writing that evolve as technology changes.</p>
<p class="content">I have experience in web fromatting and design using HTML5 and CSS. I also have some journalistic experience as a former student writer for <em>Great Lakes Echo</em>, Michigan State's online envrionmental news service. I hope to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to company growth and productivity in a professional work environment.
